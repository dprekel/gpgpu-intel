Device Initialization:




Kernel Compilation:
- Finish Backend Compilation
- Write functions for determination of interface IDs and InterfaceVersions
- Write function for construction of internalOptions string (query info from device structs)
- Freeing memory after compilation (writing destructor)
- Understand how program binary is intercepted from Intercept Layer
- Test driver with different IGC versions from Github and Ubuntu repos
- Is Mutex required?
- Add macros with Error codes
- Figuring out why we have PLT dispatch between library functions

Linking to Disassembler:
- I don't know how difficult it gets
